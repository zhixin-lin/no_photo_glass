# SMART GLAZING FOR ART DISPLAY: OOPS NO PHOTOS PLZ
Smart Vitrine Glass That Helps Museum Visitors Better Focus on Appreciating Art by Reducing the Use of Photography


The phenomenon of camera tourism in museums has become prevalent as image-rich social media increasingly gains popularity. Photographs almost act like proof of ones' taste for arts. However, the over-focus on snapping photos could be troublesome as one's attention is stolen away from the artwork itself. Psychological researches have shown the existence of the "photo-taking-impairment effect". To put it simply, people tend to remember less of the objects they photographed than those they only observed.

I proposed a smart vitrine glass that dynamically changes its transparency state based on the detection of photo-taking action, which acts as a playful reminder for people to pay more attention to appreciating artworks and to reflect on their own behaviors.
