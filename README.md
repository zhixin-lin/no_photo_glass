# SMART GLAZING FOR ART DISPLAY
Smart Glass That Helps Museum Visitors Better Focus on Appreciating Art by Reducing the Use of Photography


The phenomenon of camera tourism in museums has become prevalent as image-rich social media increasingly gains popularity. However, the over-focus on snapping photos could be troublesome as one’s attention is stolen away from the artwork itself. Psychological research has shown the existence of the “photo-taking-impairment effect”. The irony is that while people snap photos to remember moments better, they in fact tend to remember less of the objects they photographed than those they only observed due to the decreased level of cognitive engagement.

Smart glazing for artworks is an intervention that helps museum visitors better focus on appreciating art by reducing the cognitive reliance on photography. It dynamically changes its transparency state to opaque when the action of photo-taking is detected, which acts as a light-hearted reminder for visitors to see artworks with their own eyes instead of through a camera lens.

The working prototype utilizes electrochromic glass material, object detection machine learning algorithm, and Arduino relay control. Electrochromic glass could change its tint and transparency when a voltage is applied. It is conventionally used in partition walls for office meeting rooms and hotel bathrooms. This project finds an innovative way to apply this material in a brand new museum context through marrying it with computer vision.
